\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

We have presented an approach that is a blend between occupancy mapping and
object detection, allowing for the generation of probabilistic object detection
maps. These maps not only capture object detections, but also capture regions
where objects are known to be absent, or areas where there is uncertainty. The
Bayesian framework that is used here is easily amendable to incorporating other
sensor measurements, such as from a multi-modal platform that includes camera,
and temporal propagation of the detection map to capture the dynamics of the
scene. Future work will consider these extensions and tractable ways to evaluate
more complex observation models.
