\section{Discussion} \label{sec:discussion}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Discuss comparison to vote3d, vote3deep, fcn. Stress that
    \aku{hopefully} while we are still in the same ballpark as these types of
    methods and don't blow anyone out of the water, the key contribution is a
    representation that allows for additional functionality.
  \item Discuss performance, potential to include more information, either from
    other sensors or by propagating in time, or priors (e.g., cars are on the road)
\end{itemize}
