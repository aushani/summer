Estimating the pose of visible and occluded objects in the environment is a core
competency for autonomous robotic systems. Standard object detection pipelines
typically report a list of object locations per class, but do not directly
support reasoning about where objects \emph{could} be. In this work, we work
towards augmenting the state-of-the-art LIDAR detection algorithms with a notion
of free and unknown space. Importantly, this distinction enables computing a
distribution over per class object locations, which allows reasoning about
anywhere in the immediate environment, including into occluded regions. We
evaluate our method on the publicly available KITTI dataset.
