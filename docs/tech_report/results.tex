  \caption{In \figref{fig:nb}, we see an example of a Na\"ive Bayes model for a
    car. Voxels are colored by z-height, and only voxels that are likely to be
    occupied are rendered. In \figref{fig:clt}, we see the \ac{CLT} as computed
    over the model. Only edges between voxels that are usually occupied are
    shown, with edges above the ground plane rendered as thicker lines. In
    \figref{fig:sn}, we see the model augmented with surface normals. Each voxel
    is colored by the most commonly observed surface normal orientation. The hue
    represents the surface normal's rotation about the vertical axis, and the
    saturation represents the surface normal's angle from the xy plane.}

We demonstrate the performance of our proposed method by performing evaluates on the
publicly available KITTI dataset.

\subsection{Setup}

All experiments were run on the KITTI dataset \cite{Geiger2013IJRR}. We ran our
implementation on a machine with an Intel Xeon CPU (running single threaded) and a
NVIDIA TITAN X \ac{GPU}.

\subsection{Parameter Selection}

\aku{\ldots}

\subsection{CLT vs Greedy Approximation}

Show results regard the greedy approximate: how much of the pairwise mutual
information is recovered?

\subsection{Detection Results on KITTI Object Challenge}

\begin{itemize}
  \item 1-gram (independence assumption)
  \item Greedy Approximation
  \item Full \ac{CLT}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Detection Map}

Qualitative results, showing probabilistic detections, reasoning about
occlusion.

\subsection{Runtime Performance}

On average, it too \aku{\unit{1 million}{\sec}} to process \aku{...}
