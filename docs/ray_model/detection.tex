\section{Detection}

We want to build a map that represents the probability that a object of a
particular class exists at any particular position $(x, y)$ and orientation
$\theta$:
%
\begin{align}
  p(\text{ object of class $c$ at $(x, y)$ and orientation $\theta$ } | \mathbf{Z})
  \text{.}
\end{align}
%
We call this the local map. To build this map for every class $c$, position $(x,
y)$ and $\theta$, we compute \eqref{eq:p_obj_z} using the 2-gram model as
described by \eqref{eq:2gram_model}.
