\section{Detection}

We want to build a map that represents the probability that a object exists at
any particular position $(x, y)$ and orientation $\theta$:
%
\begin{align}
  p(\text{ object at $(x, y)$ and orientation $\theta$ } | \mathbf{Z})
  \text{.}
\end{align}
%
We call this the local map. To build this map for every given $(x, y)$ and
$\theta$, we compute \eqref{eq:detection_prob}. Additionally, we can perform
non-maximal suppression to produce just a list of detections and their positions
and orientations.
